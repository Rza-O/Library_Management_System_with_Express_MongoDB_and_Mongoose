## 📦 API Endpoints

### 1. **Books**

#### ➕ Create Book  
`POST /api/books`

#### 📚 Get All Books  
`GET /api/books`  
Supports query:  
`/api/books?filter=FANTASY&sortBy=createdAt&sort=desc&limit=5`

#### 🔍 Get Book by ID  
`GET /api/books/:bookId`

#### ✏️ Update Book  
`PUT /api/books/:bookId`

#### ❌ Delete Book  
`DELETE /api/books/:bookId`

---

### 2. **Borrow**

#### 📥 Borrow a Book  
`POST /api/borrow`  
Business Logic:
- Checks availability and quantity
- Deducts quantity
- Auto-disables availability if copies run out
- Saves borrow record

#### 📊 Borrowed Books Summary  
`GET /api/borrow`  
Returns:
```json
[
  {
    "book": {
      "title": "1984",
      "isbn": "9780451524935"
    },
    "totalQuantity": 5
  }
]

```
